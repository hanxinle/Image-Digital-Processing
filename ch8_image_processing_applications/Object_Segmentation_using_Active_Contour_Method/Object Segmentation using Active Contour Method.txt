***** Performing active contour based image segmentation - activecontour() *****

Let us being by reading an input image as:
A = imread('filename.extension');

We require the read image to be single channel image, therefore:
A = rgb2gray(A);

In order to perform active contour segmentation, we need to initialize the contour for evolution. Therefore we initialize contour using a mask as:
mask = zeros(size(A));
mask(10:end-10,10:end-10) = 1;

Now for active contour segmentation, MATLAB has a function by the name 'activecontout()' which take input arguments in the order - input image, initial contour (mask) and number of iterations for evolution:
bw = activecontour(A, mask, 300);
It results in an binary image where the segmented objects are shown as blobs.

Display the images side-by-side to visualize the result of active contour segmentation.
